AI DSL - Infrastructure Design: Agent Runner
==============================================

Overview
--------
Simplest effective runtime for running .ai files as automated agents.
No AWS, no Azure, no queues, no event bus.
The .ai file IS the job definition. The filesystem IS the queue.
Cron IS the scheduler.

Architecture
------------
A cron job and a folder.

  /jobs
    /expense-review
      expense.ai              # the program
      prompts/                 # named .prompt files
      inbox/                   # drop CSVs/JSON here (trigger)
      outbox/                  # results land here
      archive/                 # processed inputs move here
    /ticket-triage
      triage.ai
      prompts/
      inbox/
      outbox/
      archive/
    /invoice-processing
      invoice.ai
      prompts/
      inbox/
      outbox/
      archive/

How It Works
------------
1. Watcher script runs every N minutes (cron, Task Scheduler, GitHub Actions)
2. Checks each job's inbox/ for new files
3. If new file found, runs the .ai file against it
4. Writes structured output to outbox/
5. Moves processed input to archive/
6. Logs every run for audit trail

Where It Runs
-------------
- Local laptop with Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Mac/Linux)
- $5/mo Linux VPS
- Free-tier GitHub Actions on a schedule
- Raspberry Pi in a closet

Scaling Path (Only When Needed)
-------------------------------
- Multiple files per second       -> add SQLite queue
- Need web UI for HITL reviews    -> add small Flask/FastAPI app
- Multi-user                      -> add auth and job isolation
- Enterprise                      -> then talk about cloud infra

Why This Over Zapier/Power Automate
------------------------------------
- No vendor lock-in
- No per-action pricing
- .ai files are version controlled and auditable
- Business rules are readable, not buried in a visual canvas
- Runs anywhere, costs almost nothing
- Scales up incrementally, not all-or-nothing
